<p class="p-for-secondpage">The night after I realized the truth, I went insomnia. I lay on the bed, tumbling around, and still didn't can believe I will lose my friend. But I can not reject this opportunity, my family providing everything and entrusting their hopes into my future, for my family, I have to accept this. I woke up from my bed, sit, and open the desktop, I want to do some research of what exactly the U.S.A was.</p>

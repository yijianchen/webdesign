<p>When I was in elementary school, I was been told that I have a chance to immigrate to the U.S.A, back then this is huge luck of going out and making money in the U.S.A. Before the time came by, I feel a little <a href="secondpage.html">nervus</a>.

<p>The day becoming closer and closer, I still didn't prepare for this journey, it is better to say that I didn't know how to prepare at all; new environment, new friends, new cultures, every unknowns making me feel stressful. I tried to numb myself to not think it anymore, by <a href="Fourthpage.html">playing video games</a>, it gives me a little consolation.</p>
